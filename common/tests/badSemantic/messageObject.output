messageObject.tyco:13.1: 
  I have come across a message targeted at an undeclared channel x
messageObject.tyco:17.3: 
  [Unification Error] 
  I could not find label aNiceLabel in the following type for the location x of an object:
	{pop: , push: }
  This is the point in the program where unification failed.
  The source of the problem can be at a distant point in the source code.
messageObject.tyco:23.1: 
  [Unification Error] 
  For the message targeted at x, I was expecting the type:
	Integer
  but found the following type:
	Boolean
  (or possibly the other way round.)
  (I was trying to unify the val-labelled component of an open record with
  a closed record.)
  This is the point in the program where unification failed.
  The source of the problem can be at a distant point in the source code.
messageObject.tyco:29.1: 
  [Unification Error] 
  For the message targeted at x, I was expecting the type:
	Boolean
  but found the following type:
	a3 a4
  (or possibly the other way round.)
  (I was trying to unify the val-labelled component of an open record with
  a closed record, when I found type sequences with different lengths.)
  This is the point in the program where unification failed.
  The source of the problem can be at a distant point in the source code.
messageObject.tyco:35.1:

  I could not find label push in the following type for the target x:
	{val: a6 a7}
  This is the point in the program where unification failed.

	{getb: {val: Boolean}, geti: {val: Integer}, gets: {val: String}, printb: Boolean, printi: Integer, prints: String, putb: Boolean {done: }, puti: Integer {done: }, puts: String {done: }}
  but found the following type:
	Boolean
  (I was trying to unify the val-labelled component of an open record with
  an open record, when I found a non record type.)
  This is the point in the program where unification failed.
  The source of the problem can be at a distant point in the source code.
messageObject.tyco:47.1:

  [Unification Error] 
  For the object located at x, I was expecting the type:
	{pop: , push: }
  but found the following type:
	{val: a23 a24}
