newIntBis.tyco:17.11: 
  [Unification Error] 
  For the message targeted at a, I was expecting the type:
	<>
  but found the following type:
	Integer
  (I was trying to unify the val-labelled component of an open record with
  an open record, when I found a non record type.)
  This is the point in the program where unification failed.
  The source of the problem can be at a distant point in the source code.
newIntBis.tyco:17.3: 
  [Unification Error] 
  For the object located at a, I was expecting the type:
	Integer
  but found the following type:
	<>
  (or possibly the other way round.)
  (I was trying to unify the val-labelled component of an open record with
  a closed record.)
  This is the point in the program where unification failed.
  The source of the problem can be at a distant point in the source code.
