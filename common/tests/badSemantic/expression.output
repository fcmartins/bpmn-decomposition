expression.tyco:13.12: 
  [Unification Error] 
  I was expecting an Integer expression in the left operand of an arithmetic expression,
  but was confronted with the following type:
	Boolean
  This is the point in the program where unification failed.
  The source of the problem can be at a distant point in the source code.
expression.tyco:13.25: 
  [Unification Error] 
  I was expecting an Integer expression in the right operand of an arithmetic expression,
  but was confronted with the following type:
	String
  This is the point in the program where unification failed.
  The source of the problem can be at a distant point in the source code.
expression.tyco:13.1: 
  [Unification Error] 
  For the message targeted at io, I was expecting the type:
	Integer
  but found the following type:
	Integer {done: }
  (or possibly the other way round.)
  (I was trying to unify the puti-labelled component of an open record with
  a closed record, when I found type sequences with different lengths.)
  This is the point in the program where unification failed.
  The source of the problem can be at a distant point in the source code.
