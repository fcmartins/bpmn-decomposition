poly.tyco:10.1: 
  [Unification Error] 
  For the message targeted at x, I was expecting the type:
	Integer
  but found the following type:
	Boolean
  (I was trying to unify the val-labelled component of an open record with
  an open record.)
  This is the point in the program where unification failed.
  The source of the problem can be at a distant point in the source code.
