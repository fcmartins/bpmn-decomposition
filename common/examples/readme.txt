This directory contains meaningful examples that are to be delivered with
the releases.

Any TyCO program that would make no sense to TyCO programmers
should go into the test directories.

Each file must start with the standard header (header.tyc).
Sources must be documented and following the TyCO coding conventions.

For each tyco source file, there should be a .input and .output file.
For example:

	mathServer.tyco
	mathServerinput
	mathServer.output
